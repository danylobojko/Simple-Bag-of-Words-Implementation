# Simple-Bag-of-Words-Implementation
A simple Bag-of-Words (BoW) implementation for customer review classification. The project demonstrates how different machine learning models perform on the same dataset using the BoW representation.

## Features
- Text preprocessing and Bag-of-Words vectorization
- Comparison of multiple classifiers (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.)
- Evaluation with accuracy and performance metrics
- Easy-to-follow baseline for NLP tasks
